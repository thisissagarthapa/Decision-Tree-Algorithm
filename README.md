# Decision-Tree-Algorithm

This project implements a simple Decision Tree classifier to predict whether an individual has lung cancer based on two features: `Age` and `Smoking_Years`. The dataset includes individuals with various ages and smoking histories, and the classifier predicts whether they are likely to have lung cancer.

## Dataset

The dataset contains three columns:

1. **Age**: Age of the individual (years).
2. **Smoking_Years**: Number of years the individual has been smoking.
3. **Lung_Cancer**: A binary label where `1` indicates that the individual has lung cancer and `0` means they do not.

### Sample Data

| Age | Smoking_Years | Lung_Cancer |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 71  | 0             | 0           |
| 34  | 37            | 0           |
| 80  | 12            | 0           |
| 40  | 10            | 0           |
| 43  | 9             | 0           |
